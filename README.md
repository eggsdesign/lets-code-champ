# Let's Code Champ ðŸ™Œ

## Code courses for EGGS employees

This is a series of sessions that will be spread out through the Fall of 2020. You can join through video or in person, and the format will be highly interactive so you will be coding plenty and sometimes showing and telling to the rest of the group (if you want). The coding tool we will be using is https://codesandbox.io/, so no need to install anything before the session.

I will post the learning materials here, along with homework to do between sessions. This is an experiment, so please let me know if you want me to adjust the format.


## Who is this for?

Anyone who works at EGGS and who wants to learn or re-learn programming for web.

## What can I learn?

This course will focus on programming for web, which is a great stepping stone to learn more about coding. If there are other topics you would like to know more about, that I havenâ€™t listed, feel free to let me know and hopefully we can add some of those too.
